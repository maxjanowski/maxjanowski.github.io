Thanks to Jordan Goodman from our Board of Directors, for finding an old vinyl
recording of a 1960 concert at Congregation Rodfei Sholom-Oir Chodosh, in
Chicago.  The recording features fourteen of Max Janowski's works, and includes
stellar performances by Cantor Maurice Levy and soprano Beatrice Horwitz. 
Jordan was in the children's choir at the time.

The original performance includes, along with Levy and Horwitz, the voices of
the Adult and Children's Choirs of Congration Rodfei Sholom â€” Oir Chodosh.  It
was originally recorded live to reel-to-reel tape on February 13th, 1960, and later
transfered to vinyl.  We have produced a digital version for your enjoyment, leaving the original audio unchanged.
